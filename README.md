# README

A project in basic cryptanalysis. Contains some basic cryptanalytic algorithms that can be imported into other programs and a command line program for running them standalone.

## Frequency Analysis

Functionality for analysing letter, bigram and trigram frequency in supplied text. Can be used to help break ciphers or to determine if output of an attempted decipher is likely to be plaintext.

## Caesar Cipher

Functionality for enciphering or deciphering text using a caesar cipher algorithm. Also capable of attempting an automatic search across possible keys for the correct key, using frequency analysis.
